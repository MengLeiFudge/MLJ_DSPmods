## 模组简介 Mod Introduction

### 新分馏塔、物流交互站 New fractionator, logistics interaction station

`![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/19/wqcyU5M2QOr3knC.png)`

万物分馏添加了全新的建筑，它们的效果非常强大！

* 交互塔：将分馏塔原胚培养为不同的分馏塔。除此之外，当交互塔的正面输入并且两侧无连接时，输入的物品会上传至分馏数据中心。
* 矿物复制塔：复制各种矿物，包括黑雾特有掉落。有一定概率得到复制精华。需要在分馏数据中心解锁并升级对应配方。
* 点数聚集塔：将增产点数集中到部分物品上，从而产出携带更多的增产点数的物品。需要在分馏数据中心升级点数聚集效率层次。
* 量子复制塔：利用分馏精华卓越的可塑性复制各种物品。增产点数可以减少分馏精华的消耗。运行时会自动从分馏数据中心扣除四种分馏精华。需要在分馏数据中心解锁并升级对应配方。
* 转化塔：将物品转化为与其相关的其他物品。有一定概率得到转化精华。需要在分馏数据中心解锁并升级对应配方。
* 物流交互站：可以与分馏数据中心进行物品交互的行星内物流运输站。

Fractionate Everything has added brand new buildings which are very powerful in their effects!

* Interaction Tower: Cultivates the fractionator proto-germ into a different fractionator. In addition to this, when the
  front of the Interaction Tower is input and there are no connections on either side, the input items will be uploaded
  to the Fractionation Data Center.
* Mineral Duplication Tower: Duplicates various minerals, including Black Mist-specific drops. There is a certain
  probability of getting a replication essence. You need to unlock and upgrade the corresponding recipe in the
  Fractionation Data Center.
* Point Aggregation Tower: Concentrate production increase points on some items, thus producing items with more
  production increase points. Requires upgrading the Point Aggregation Efficiency Level in the Fractionation Data
  Center.
* Quantum Replication Tower: Utilizes the superior malleability of Fractionation Essence to replicate various items.
  Increased production points reduce the consumption of Fractionation Essence. Four types of Fractionated Essence are
  automatically deducted from the Fractionation Data Center when running. You need to unlock and upgrade the
  corresponding recipe in the Fractionation Data Center.
* Conversion Tower: Convert items into other items related to them. There is a certain probability of obtaining
  Transformation Essence. You need to unlock and upgrade the corresponding recipe in the Fractionation Data Center.
* Logistics Interaction Station: An intra-planetary logistics station that can interact with the Fractionation Data
  Center.

### 抽奖系统 Raffle System

抽奖是很重要的一环。快来试试你的手气吧！

### 配方升级与突破、建筑升级与强化 Recipe upgrades and breakthroughs, building upgrades and enhancements

无论是配方还是建筑，都需要不断升级，才能达到最强力的状态！

* 配方升级：使用指定配方分馏即可持续获得经验，经验达标后可自动升级！
* 配方突破：配方品质有白、绿、蓝、紫、红、金，达到一定等级，收集足够数目的回响，即可突破到新的品质！
* 建筑升级：建筑有很多实用的升级项，例如流动输出堆叠、产物输出堆叠，可以摆脱集装的烦恼！
* 建筑强化：建筑完全升级后，即可逐步强化至+20，加快速率，提升产能！

Both recipes and buildings need to be constantly upgraded to reach their most powerful state!

* Recipe upgrading: using the specified recipe fractionation can be continuously gained experience, experience can be
  automatically upgraded after reaching the standard!
* Recipe Breakthrough: Recipe qualities are white, green, blue, purple, red, and gold, reaching a certain level and
  collecting a sufficient number of echoes can break through to a new quality!
* Building Upgrade: There are many practical upgrades for buildings, such as flow output stacking and product output
  stacking, which can get rid of the trouble of assembling!
* Building Enhancement: Once a building is fully upgraded, it can be gradually enhanced to +20 to speed up the rate and
  increase production capacity!

### 新分馏科技 New Fractionation Technology

除了使用矩阵解锁的常规科技，还有一部分科技是通过特殊方式解锁的！

将产物上传至分馏数据中心，即可解锁对应科技，得到合成它的配方~

至于怎么做，就需要你在游戏中研究了！

In addition to the regular techs that are unlocked using the Matrix, there are some techs that are unlocked in a special
way!

By uploading a product to the Fractionation Data Center, you can unlock the corresponding technology and get the recipe
to synthesize it.

As for how to do it, you need to research it in the game!

### 任务系统、成就系统 Quest System, Achievement System

一个游戏怎么能没有任务系统和成就系统呢？你说是吧！

接取任务并完成，即可获得各种奖励~

完成成就，就会解锁开发日志！等等，你是在这里写小说吗？

How can a game not have a quest system and an achievement system? You think so!

Take a mission and complete it to get various rewards.

Completing achievements will unlock the development log! Wait, are you writing a novel here?

## 致谢 Credits

- 特别感谢jinxOAO。
  该MOD的灵感来源于他的[FractionateUniverse](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/jinxOAO/FractionateUniverse/)
  ，没有他的模组就不会有万物分馏。
  他认为分馏塔应该往不同功能区做，而非简单的效率升级，这正是1.x版本有各种各样分馏塔的主要原因。
- 特别感谢Awbugl。作为创世之书目前的代码编写者，他帮助我解决了MOD编写的绝大多数难点，非常感谢他的无私帮助。
  并且，万物分馏很多代码逻辑参考了创世之书的代码，例如主页面加载弹窗、与其他MOD进行适配等等，这方便了我的开发。
- 特别感谢Starfi5h。他帮助我解决了一些代码编写上的难题，尤其是特殊bug的处理。
  可以说，我编写戴森球计划的MOD过程中较为罕见、棘手的问题，他都可以给予一定帮助。
- 特别感谢soarqin。万物分馏2.0的UI组件完全来源于他封装好的类，这极大方便了我在UI上面的开发。
- 特别感谢L。作为最早一批的测试人员，他的积极测试与鼓励使我拥有坚持完善万物分馏的决心。
  文档最顶端的[图片](https://s2.loli.net/2024/04/08/LtlNkxZD4jmdbFX.jpg)
  就是他提供的。
- 特备感谢飞鸿。他测试MOD并提供了大量建议，例如部分分馏塔的功能想法，并反馈给我矩阵分馏配方的不合理性。
  分馏损毁功能正是源于他的测试，这个功能大幅提高了MOD的游戏体验。
- 特别感谢聆汐。他是万物分馏2.0版本前期测试的主要人员，并对MOD功能、数值方面提出了很多建议，也反馈了大量Bug。
- 特别感谢万物分馏交流群、创世之书交流群的群友，正是由于他们的不断反馈，我才能修复MOD中存在的问题，并对MOD进行功能上的修改。
- 特别感谢使用万物分馏的每一位玩家，希望你们能感受到分馏的乐趣。
  如果你有任何错误信息或建议，欢迎加入[万物分馏反馈群](https://qm.qq.com/q/zzicz6j9zW)
  并反馈给我（@萌泪酱）。
- Special thanks to jinxOAO. the mod was inspired by
  his [FractionateUniverse](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/jinxOAO/FractionateUniverse/), without his module there
  would be no Fractionate Everything. He also helped me solve the problem of buildings not accepting new fractionation
  recipes when tech is unlocked, provided a way to modify the power consumption of buildings, and pointed out that there
  was little point in upgrading fractionator towers, and that it would be better to make fractionators with new
  features. This is exactly why the fractionator now has a different function, not just an efficiency boost.
- Special thanks to Awbugl. as the current coder of the Genesis Book, he has helped me solve most of the difficulties in
  writing the mod, and his selfless help is greatly appreciated. Moreover, many of the code logic of Fractionate
  Everything references the code of Book of Genesis, such as loading pop-up windows on the main page, adapting with
  other mods, etc., which facilitates my development.
- Special thanks to L, as the first batch of testers, his active testing and encouragement make me have the
  determination to insist on perfecting Fractionation. The [image](https://s2.loli.net/2024/04/08/LtlNkxZD4jmdbFX.jpg)
  at the top of the document is provided by him.
- Special thanks to 飞鸿, who tested the MOD and provided tons of advice. He provided some of the ideas for the
  functionality of the fractionator and gave me feedback on the irrationality of the matrix fractionation recipe. The
  Fractionation Damage feature originated from his testing, and this feature drastically improves the gameplay
  experience of the mod.
- Special thanks to the group members of the Genesis Book exchange group, it was thanks to their constant feedback that
  I was able to fix the problems in the mod and make functional changes to the mod.
- Special thanks to every player who uses Fractionate Everything, I hope you have fun with fractionation. If you have
  any bug or idea, please give me feedback on [Github Issue](https://github.com/MengLeiFudge/MLJ_DSPmods/issues/new).
